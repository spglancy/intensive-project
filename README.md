# Intensive Project
The purpose of this product is to help people form local communities with common interests.  It does so by allowing users to tag their posts with topics, as well as the option to post so that only users within a certain distance can see the post.  Users are able to see all posts that they are within range of, however they can also filter their feed to show only posts of a certain topic.  I used a RESTful node backend with a MongoDB database.  I plan to use the geolocation API to control the geographical posting.
